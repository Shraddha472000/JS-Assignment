Question 2->

var: 
     1.var declarations are globally   scoped or function scoped.
     2.var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope.
Ex:
    var x = 5;
    var y = 6;
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + y;

let: 
     1.let is block scoped.
     2.let can be updated but not re-declared.
Ex:
     var x = 10; // Here x is 10
     {
      let x = 2; // Here x is 2
     }
    // Here x is 10

const:
      1.const declarations are block. scoped.This declaration creates a constant whose scope can be either global or local to the block in which it is declared.
      
      2.const cannot be updated or re-declared.
Ex:
     const PI = 3.14159265359;

Question 3->

Data types in Javascript are:
1.Strings
2.Numbers
3.Boolean
4.Array
5.Object
6.undefined
7.Null


1.strings :

A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "Hello world".

Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes.

Example:
var name1 = "abcd";   // Using double quotes
var name2 = 'wxyz';   // Using single quotes

2.Numbers:

JavaScript has only one type of numbers.

Numbers can be written with, or without decimals.

Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation:

Example:
var x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals
var x2 = 34;        // Written without decimals


3.Boolean:

Booleans can only have two values: true or false.
Booleans are often used in conditional testing.
 
Example:
var x = 5;
var y = 5;
var z = 6;
(x == y)       // Returns true
(x == z)       // Returns false


4.Arrays:

JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

Array items are separated by commas.

Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.

Example:
var fruits = ["Mango", "Apple", "Watermelon","Banana"];

5.Objects:

JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.

Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.

Example:
var man = {firstName:"abc", lastName:"xyz", age:50, city:mumbai};

6.Undefined:

In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.

Example:
var a; 

7.Null:

In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.*/
